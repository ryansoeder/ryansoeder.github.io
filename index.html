          Aspiring Front-End Web developer and recent graduate of the Front-End
          course at Code Louisville. My experience as an educator has instilled
          a passion for distilling complex concepts into practical steps,
          creative problem solving, through communication, and systems. Nothing
          makes me happier than putting my entire focus into a project and
          seeing it though.

        <p>
          I was one of the mentors in Ryan's Frond-End class of Code Louisville
          program. During 12 weeks course, Ryan exceeded class expectations as
          student. He had been "Rock Star" of the whole course. He not only
          showed a great attitude towards learning new technologies but was able
          to help a lot of other students to succeed with their graduation
          projects. For example, he was making Pull Requests with suggestions,
          meeting with classmates outside of the class to help them out with
          their questions, being positively active during all conversations. I
          had the impression that Ryan was genially enjoying the program.
          <br /><br />
          Without any hesitation, I would recommend Ryan as solid junior web
          developer as he has all of the necessary skills, attitudes, and
          potential to become a great specialist.
