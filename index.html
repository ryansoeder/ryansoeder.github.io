        Bio
      </h2>
      <p id="bio">
        Aspiring Front-End Web developer and recent graduate of the Front-End
        course at Code Louisville. My experience as an educator has instilled a
        passion for distilling complex concepts into practical steps, creative
        problem solving, through communication, and systems. Nothing makes me
        happier than putting my entire focus into a project and seeing it
        though.

      <h2>
        Reference
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was one of the mentors in Ryan's Frond-End class of Code Louisville
        program. During 12 weeks course, Ryan exceeded class expectations as
        student. He had been "Rock Star" of the whole course. He not only showed
        a great attitude towards learning new technologies but was able to help
        a lot of other students to succeed with their graduation projects. For
        example, he was making Pull Requests with suggestions, meeting with
        classmates outside of the class to help them out with their questions,
        being positively active during all conversations. I had the impression
        that Ryan was genially enjoying the program. <br><br> Without any hesitation, I
        would recommend Ryan as solid junior web developer as he has all of the
        necessary skills, attitudes, and potential to become a great specialist.
