				<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>
					Web Developer and recent graduate of the Front-End Web Development
					course at Code Louisville. I am a self-starter and a fast learner. My
					experience as an educator has instilled a passion for distilling
					complex concepts into practical steps, creative problem solving,
					thorough communication, and efficient systems. Nothing makes me
					happier than putting my entire focus into a project and seeing it
					through.

				<h2>Reference</h2>
				<p>
					"I was one of the mentors in Ryan's Frond-End class of Code Louisville
					program. During 12 weeks course, Ryan exceeded class expectations as
					student. He had been "Rock Star" of the whole course. He not only
					showed a great attitude towards learning new technologies but was able
					to help a lot of other students to succeed with their graduation
					projects. For example, he was making Pull Requests with suggestions,
					meeting with classmates outside of the class to help them out with
					their questions, being positively active during all conversations. I
					had the impression that Ryan was genially enjoying the program.
				</p>
				<p>
					Without any hesitation, I would recommend Ryan as solid junior web
					developer as he has all of the necessary skills, attitudes, and
					potential to become a great specialist."
